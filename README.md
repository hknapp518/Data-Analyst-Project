# Data-Analyst-Project

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world data analysis environment using SQL Server and Power BI. It involves creating a sample business request and defining a business overview to establish the analysis context. The project includes refining, transforming, and cleaning raw data to ensure it is analysis-ready. The processed data is then loaded into Power BI to build interactive dashboards and reports. Finally, all project components, including queries, insights, and visualizations, are documented and showcased on a website.

## Step 1

The first step in this project is to review the business request email from Ana, the Sales Manager. This email outlines the key requirements and objectives for our analysis. By extracting essential details, we can define the business needs, refine the data scope, and ensure that our analysis aligns with business goals.
