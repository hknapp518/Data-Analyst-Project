# Data-Analyst-Project

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world data analysis environment using SQL Server and Power BI. It involves creating a sample business request and defining a business overview to establish the analysis context. The project includes refining, transforming, and cleaning raw data to ensure it is analysis-ready. The processed data is then loaded into Power BI to build interactive dashboards and reports. Finally, all project components, including queries, insights, and visualizations, are documented and showcased on a website.
