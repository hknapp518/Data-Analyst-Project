# Data-Analyst-Project

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world data analysis environment using SQL Server and Power BI. It involves creating a sample business request and defining a business overview to establish the analysis context. The project includes refining, transforming, and cleaning raw data to ensure it is analysis-ready. The processed data is then loaded into Power BI to build interactive dashboards and reports. Finally, all project components, including queries, insights, and visualizations, are documented and showcased on a website.

## Step 1

The first step in this project is to review the business request email from Ana, the Sales Manager. This email outlines the key requirements and objectives for our analysis. By extracting essential details, we can define the business needs, refine the data scope, and ensure that our analysis aligns with business goals.

## Step 2: Setting Up and cleaning the data

To begin the analysis, we will set up our data environment by installing SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and loading the AdventureWorks databases. This will provide access to both the restructured data warehouse (post-restructured) and the lightweight raw data (pre-restructured). For this phase of the project, we will focus on three key tables: the Customer table, the Date table, and the Product table. We will clean the data by selecting only the relevant columns needed to address the specific business requests.
